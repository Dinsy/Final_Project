            <h3><u>Scenario:</u> Your close friend, Alex, has called you to meet at a quiet caf√©. During your conversation, Alex reveals that they have been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Alex expresses deep concerns about how to balance work with the impending treatment, and the uncertainty of how much time they have left. There's a mix of fear and sadness in Alex's voice as they share this news with you.</h3>

                            <p>Option A is the best approach as it shows empathy and understanding. It acknowledges the seriousness of Alex's situation and offers emotional and practical support without making assumptions or offering unsolicited advice.</p>

                            <p><b>Option B</b> is dismissive of Alex's current life and job, which may still hold significant meaning for them.</p>
                            <p><b>Option C</b> disregards Alex's emotional state and the gravity of their diagnosis, suggesting a distraction rather than addressing the real issue.</p>
                            <p><b>Option D</b> potentially gives false hope and overlooks the need for emotional support.</p>
                            <p><b>Option E</b> shows a lack of willingness to engage in a difficult but important conversation, offering superficial reassurance instead.</p></>
